# CARENet Model Architecture

This repository contains the **core model definition** (PyTorch) for the paper: 
**"CARENet: Multi-task Prognostic Prediction for Rhabdomyosarcoma from Multi-view Medical Images"**, published in *npj Digital Medicine*.

## 📄 File Description
- `CARENet.py`: The complete implementation of the proposed deep learning architecture, including:
  - `CNNWithResAttention`: The main backbone.
  - `CBAM`: Convolutional Block Attention Module.
  - `ResBlock`: The residual learning unit.

## 🛠 Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch >= 1.11

## ⚠️ Note on Data and Training
This repository provides the model architecture to ensure the reproducibility of the network design. The training pipeline and data preprocessing scripts rely on a proprietary medical image analysis platform (Onekey) and clinical datasets that cannot be made public due to privacy regulations. These are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
